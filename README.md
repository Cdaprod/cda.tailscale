To create a `README.md` for a `cda.tailscale` repository and an ACL file structure based on GitOps practices with GitHub as detailed in [Tailscale's GitOps ACLs documentation](https://tailscale.com/kb/1306/gitops-acls-github), here's a suggested outline:

---

### README.md for `cda.tailscale`

**Repository Name:** `cda.tailscale`

**Description:**  
This repository contains Tailscale ACL configurations for the `cda` network, managed via GitOps principles. It enables streamlined and version-controlled management of network access rules.

**Directory Structure:**
- `/acls`: Contains the main ACL configuration files.
- `/scripts`: Includes utility scripts for deployment or testing.
- `/docs`: Documentation related to specific ACL rules and setup guides.

**Main Files:**
- `/acls/main.acl`: The primary Tailscale ACL file.
- `/scripts/deploy.sh`: Script to deploy ACL changes.
- `/docs/setup.md`: Guide for setting up and managing ACLs.

**How to Contribute:**
1. Fork the repository.
2. Make changes in your fork.
3. Submit a pull request with a clear description of the changes.

**Deployment:**
- Changes to `/acls/main.acl` are reviewed and merged into the main branch.
- Upon merge, an automated script deploys the new ACL configuration to the Tailscale network.

For more detailed guidelines on GitOps with Tailscale ACLs, refer to the [Tailscale documentation](https://tailscale.com/kb/1306/gitops-acls-github).

### ACL File Structure

- **`/acls/main.acl`**
  - Contains the actual ACL rules in JSON format.
  - Structure it to include groups, hosts, acls, ssh, and tagOwners as per your network needs.

Remember, this is a basic template. Customize the contents and structure to fit the specific requirements of your network and GitOps workflow.
